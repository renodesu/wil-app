# The waste hierarchy

#### Jan 29, 2021
In Australia, the bulk of kerbside recycling services are limited to household containers, packaging, paper and cardboard. This material is processed through a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF), where it is brought in by truck and sorted into different streams of materials such as paper, cardboard, glass, steel, aluminium, and some types of plastics. From here, the materials are baled up and sold on the market to manufacturing industries both in Australia and overseas.

Most recycling is sold into domestic markets, with overseas markets available for some plastic, paper and cardboard products.

There is strong demand for some types of recycled plastic, such as HDPE (i.e. milk bottles) and PET (i.e. soft drink bottles), while many other types of plastic cannot be easily recycled and are often sold as a low-value mixed plastic product.

Mixed plastics make-up a small percentage of recycling and have traditionally been sold to overseas markets, but contamination found in the bales is creating several challenges. In January 2018, China implemented their National Sword Policy, which has banned the import of recycled materials with contamination rates over 0.5%. Similar policies have now been introduced or are being considered in countries such as Malaysia, India and Indonesia.

These restrictions have impacted the recycling industry across the world, including Australia, and markets for low quality mixed plastics and mixed paper have become harder to find. This contributed to the collapse of a prominent Victorian recycler in August 2019, forcing a number of Victorian local governments to send yellow bin recycling to landfill for several months.
