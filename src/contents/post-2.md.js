The recycling industry needs us to reduce contamination by making our recycling cleaner.
Contamination can take a number of forms, such as:
* Smaller items slipping through the machines at the MRF and ending in the wrong place
* Plastic containers containing food
* Products comprised of mixed material types such as the lids and labels on containers
* Lids on bottles (lids are often from a different, harder type of plastic than the softer container)
* Soft plastics (generally defined as plastics that are soft enough to be tied into a knot and can be recycled through specialist centres) that can cause safety issues for staff, can tangle and damage the machinery, and often get mixed up in the paper material where they are a contaminant
* Other plastics which cannot be recycled through the MRF
* Non-plastic items such as ropes and cords.
